* Introduction
  This document contains all the draft mails which are sent
  to the Nodal Coordinators and other college HOD/Principal
  for the outreach remote internship program. These mails
  keep up the enthusiasm amongst the potential participants
  and also give us the idea on the progress of the
  internship program.

* Motivation
  This internship program is conducted to motivate students
  from the Nodal centers and other colleges to contribute
  towards this mission mode project run by MHRD. Students
  would be contributing towards the open source development
  community as well as improve the Virtual Labs. The
  motivation for us behind conducting such internship
  program is to do outreach activities for the Virtual Labs
  and improve its reach to as many colleges as possible.

* Draft Mails 
  + [[./initial-draft-mail.org][Initial Draft mail to call for interns]] and [[./initial-summer-internship-poster.jpeg][Initial Poster]]


* Conclusion
  Based on the issues fixed by the students would be given
  an opportunity to work as an intern in virtual labs and
  also contribute in a mission mode MHRD project. The labs
  would be improved as part of this program giving us an
  edge in outreach programs by connecting to the different
  Nodal Coordinators across the state.
