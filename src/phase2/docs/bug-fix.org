* Introduction

This document provides the guidelines on how to resolve the code
related bugs. Find the below process to code related issues.

* Guidelines

- Go to the issues page of any lab, here i have taken Artificial
  neural networks lab for your reference.
- Click on [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/artificial-neural-networks-iiith/issues][issues]] section. 
- Look for the issues that are labeled with "static-code-analysis".
- In this [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/artificial-neural-networks-iiith/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Astatic-code-analysis][link]] all the issues labeled with "static-code-analysis".
- Every [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/artificial-neural-networks-iiith/issues/60][issue]] is raised with defect description and with an example.
- Look for the example that is given with a good and a bad piece of
  code. The bad piece refers to the code with error existed. And the
  good one gives an example of how the code supposed to be.
- All The issues are raised category wise. The categories are
  code-style, compatibility, error-prone, performance, security and
  unused code.
- Each category may have one or more than one issues which are all
  same but existed in different locations. Let's say at a different
  page or at a different experiment.
- The category which consists of a single issue, is not provided with
  link.
- Please note that - if a link is given in the issue that means the
  link will navigate the intern to the page where the other issues of
  the same category are listed.
- In the such case, the intern can take the reference of the raised
  issue and fix the rest of the issue listed in the link as they are
  all of the same category issues.
