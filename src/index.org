  and approved. This presentation has the initial dates when this
  program was proposed to Choppella sir for approval. Later the dates
  have been extended based on the examination schedules in different
  Nodal Centers.

* Process
** [[./phase1][Phase 1]]
* Logistics
** Prize Money
   
* Conclusion
  Based on the issues raised the students would be given an
  opportunity to work as an intern in virtual labs and also contribute
  in a mission mode MHRD project. The labs would be improved as part
  of this program giving us an edge in outreach programs by connecting
  to the different Nodal Coordinators across the state.
