* Process
** [[https://github.com/vlead/2018-outreach-remote-internship/tree/develop/src/phase1][Phase 1]]

* Logistics
   
* Conclusion
  Based on the issues fixed by the students,they would be
  given an opportunity to work as an intern in virtual labs
  and also contribute in a mission mode MHRD project. The
  labs would be improved as part of this program giving us
  an edge in outreach programs by connecting to the
  Nodal centers and other colleges across the state.
